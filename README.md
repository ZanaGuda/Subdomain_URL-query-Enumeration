# Subdomain_URL-query-Enumeration
Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding all subdomains of a given domain. This can be useful for identifying subdomains that are hosted on different servers or used for different purposes (e.g. staging, testing, development)

In this project in order to automate the process we have used wordlists. You can also use wordlists that contain common subdomain names (e.g. "www", "mail", "admin") and combine them with the target domain to generate a list of possible subdomains.
